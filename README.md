## TL;DR

Bordaless‑SKU‑Lab is an opinionated, AI‑powered playground for inventing, validating, and optimizing SKUs (product stock‑keeping units). It bundles a reactive front‑end with generative intelligence so teams can prototype product ideas, audit SKU metadata, run market fit tests, and prepare launch assets — all in one place.

---

## Why this exists (a short manifesto)

Physical goods die repeatedly in the gap between concept and market. Metadata is inconsistent, specs leak, photos suck, and spreadsheets rot. Bordaless‑SKU‑Lab stops that rot: it gives teams an automated *workshop* where SKU ideas are forged, quality‑gated, and hardened for channel handoff. Think of it as an engineering bench for product metadata and go‑to‑market readiness.

---

## Features

* **Generate** SKU concepts from prompts, templates, or CSV seed data.
* **Verify** SKU metadata and flag inconsistencies (naming, attributes, compliance notes).
* **Optimize** pricing heuristics, packaging suggestions, and SEO‑ready titles/descriptions.
* **Prepare** launch assets: spec sheet, short product copy, and simple merch visuals.
* **Audit trail**: each SKU carries provenance metadata so you always know who changed what and why.

---

## Tech stack

* Frontend: **TypeScript**, React, Vite
* AI integration: Google Gemini (via `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable)
* Build & dev scripts: `npm` / `vite`

---

## Quickstart (local)

> requirements: Node.js (LTS), npm

```bash
# 1. clone
git clone https://github.com/MadScie254/Bordaless-SKU-Lab.git
cd Bordaless-SKU-Lab

# 2. install
npm install

# 3. create .env.local and add your Gemini key
# GEMINI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx

# 4. run
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever Vite reports) and poke around.

## App Structure (what's in this repo)

```
/ components/      # React components (cards, editors, validators)
/ services/        # API wrappers and AI client code
/ src/             # app entry (App.tsx, index.tsx)
/ public/          # static assets
package.json       # npm scripts + deps
README.md          # — you are here
```

---

## How it works (short flow)

1. **Seed** — upload CSV or type a prompt to spawn SKU candidates.
2. **Refine** — the AI suggests structured attributes and canonicalized names.
3. **Verify** — validation rules check attribute ranges, required fields, and compliance notes.
4. **Optimize** — pricing & title optimizers run simulations and suggest improvements.
5. **Export** — download CSV, spec sheets, and launch copy for downstream systems.

---

## Example usage scenarios

* Early stage founders prototyping a new product line and needing rapid SKU drafts.
* eCommerce teams standardizing metadata before shipping to marketplaces.
* Manufacturers automating spec creation and packaging recommendations.

---

## Roadmap (short)

* ✅ Basic SKU generation & attribute extraction
* ✅ Gemini integration for copy/spec generation
* 🔜 Batch CSV import + bulk verification
* 🔜 Price simulation using historical market data
* 🔜 Plugin system for marketplace exporters (Shopify, Jumia, etc.)

## Contributing

Love it? Hate it? PRs welcomed.

* Fork the repo
* Create feature branch `feature/your-thing`
* Open a PR with a clear summary and screenshots

If you're touching AI prompts or the verification rules, add unit tests and a short note describing the logic.

---

## Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` in repo root and set:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
```

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Dev server won't start**: ensure Node v18+ and run `npm ci` to get a clean install.
* **AI responses missing**: confirm `GEMINI_API_KEY` is valid and your network allows calls to Google endpoints.
* **Slow generation**: try smaller batch prompts or increase local logging to inspect timeouts.

## Ethics & Safety

Bordaless‑SKU‑Lab is a tool: always verify regulatory compliance and safety-critical specifications with domain experts. The AI assists with suggestions — it does not replace legal, safety, or regulatory review.
